# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my personal implementations of fundamental **data structures** and **algorithms**, created while learning and practicing computer science fundamentals.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of **problem-solving**, **time and space complexity**, and **software engineering principles** by implementing core concepts from scratch.

## Topics Covered

- **Data Structures**
  - Arrays  
  - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
  - Stacks and Queues  
  - Trees and Binary Search Trees  
  - Heaps and Priority Queues  
  - Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix)  
  - Hash Tables  

- **Algorithms**
  - Searching (Linear, Binary Search)  
  - Sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick Sort)  
  - Recursion and Divide & Conquer  
  - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, Topological Sort)  

## Language Used
All implementations are written in **C++**, focusing on:
- Clean and readable code  
- Modularity and reusability  
- Manual memory management practice  

## Purpose
This repository reflects my continuous effort to improve:
- **Algorithmic thinking**
- **Data structure design**
- **Code efficiency and optimization**

It will also serve as a reference for future projects where these core concepts can be applied (e.g., CPU Scheduling Simulator, Full-Stack applications, etc.).
